# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the central resource for OctoAcme’s project management processes. This living documentation is designed to help new collaborators quickly understand how we run projects—and provides direct links to all key workflow artifacts, templates, and process documents.

OctoAcme uses a clear, agile-inspired methodology to enable consistent, high-quality delivery across cross-functional teams. Projects begin with a Project One-pager that captures the problem, goals, success metrics, stakeholders, and a high-level timeline. That one-pager is validated during a kickoff, and approved initiatives move into planning where work is broken into a prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria, estimates, and a Definition of Done. Planning also captures dependencies, a release plan, and an initial risk register.

Roles and handoffs are explicit: Product Managers (PdM) own outcomes and prioritization; Project Managers (PM) coordinate schedule, risks, and communications; Developers implement and write tests; QA validates acceptance; and stakeholders provide input and approvals. Execution is tracked on a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) and supported by templates for backlog items, release notes, and risk entries.

Quality and release discipline are enforced through CI and testing standards (unit, integration, and end-to-end/smoke tests), security scanning, small pull requests, peer review, and a staged release checklist with rollback/incident playbook. Regular cadences—daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, PM+PdM alignment, and retrospectives—ensure transparency and continuous improvement.
